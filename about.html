    <h2>Why did i make this?</h2>
    <p>
      I made this website because of two main reasons.
      First of all, because i love penguins, obviously.
      Second of all, because im learning web-development and this site is mainly for me to practice my skills.
    </p>
    <h2>Will there be more in the future?</h2>
    <p>
      There probably wont be much more to this website as its just a small project i made for fun.
      Though, i will probably make other websites in the future as im currently working on a few projects.
