      I really love penguins. As you can see above, theres two pictures of two different penguins.
      One of a penguin standing still, and the other of a penguin walking.
      Now, you might be wondering, why do i love penguins so much to the point that i dedicated a whole website to it?
      Well, the answer is simple, penguins is one of the best things i know. I love how they act, how they waddle, how they eat,
      how they sometimes smack eachother in the back of the head for absolutely no reason. I love everything about penguins.
      If you couldnt tell, penguins is my favorite animal and i love them more than anything.
